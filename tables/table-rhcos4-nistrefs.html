The <tt>Audit</tt> package provides pre-configured  rules in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules</tt>. The above content can be found in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42-2-modify-success.rules</tt>.
To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d/</tt> directory:
<pre>
cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42-2-modify-success.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/
</pre>

Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
<pre>augenrules --load</pre>

Note: This rule utilizes a file provided by <tt>Audit</tt> package to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned with your needs.

</p>
<p>
Note that the Red Hat OpenShift documentation often references a block
device, such as <tt>/dev/vda</tt>. The name of the available block devices depends
on the underlying infrastructure (bare metal vs cloud), and often the specific
instance type. For example in AWS, some instance types have NVMe drives
(<tt>/dev/nvme*</tt>), others use <tt>/dev/xvda*</tt>.

You will need to look for relevant documentation for your infrastructure around this.
In many cases, the simplest thing is to boot a single machine with an Ignition
configuration that just gives you SSH access, and inspect the block devices via
e.g. the <tt>lsblk</tt> command.

For physical hardware, a good best practice is to reference devices via the
<tt>/dev/disk/by-id/</tt> or <tt>/dev/disk/by-path</tt> links.

for more detailed comparison of the features of both of the choices, and for

<br />
To specify a remote NTP server for time synchronization, perform the following:
<ul>
<li> if the system is configured to use the <tt>chronyd</tt> as the NTP daemon (the

<li> if the system is configured to use the <tt>ntpd</tt> as the NTP daemon,
edit the file <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt> as documented below.</li>
</ul>
Add or correct the following lines, substituting the IP or hostname of a remote
NTP server for <em>ntpserver</em>:
<pre>server <i>ntpserver</i></pre>
This instructs the NTP software to contact that remote server to obtain time
data.

<p>

  <td>Encrypt Partitions</td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS 4 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br /><br />
For manual installations, select the <tt>Encrypt</tt> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br /><br />
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <tt>--encrypted</tt> and <tt>--passphrase=</tt> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <tt>--passphrase=</tt> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br /><br />
By default, the <tt>Anaconda</tt> installer uses <tt>aes-xts-plain64</tt> cipher
with a minimum <tt>512</tt> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.

Note that the Red Hat OpenShift documentation often references a block

You will need to look for relevant documentation for your infrastructure around this.
In many cases, the simplest thing is to boot a single machine with an Ignition
configuration that just gives you SSH access, and inspect the block devices via
e.g. the <tt>lsblk</tt> command.

For physical hardware, a good best practice is to reference devices via the

Crypto Policies are means of enforcing certain cryptographic settings for

<tt>update-crypto-policies</tt> so that changes are applied. Changes are

Address space layout randomization (ASLR) makes it more difficult for an
attacker to predict the location of attack code they have introduced into a

ASLR makes it more difficult for an attacker to know the location of
existing code in order to re-purpose it using return oriented programming
(ROP) techniques.
