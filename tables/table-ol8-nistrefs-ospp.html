Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Oracle Linux 8 functionality (e.g., SSH) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity.
Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets)."

Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities
with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access controls to Linux.
The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new architectural components originally

provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control
policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based Access
Control, and Multi-level Security.

<tt>policycoreutils</tt> contains the policy core utilities that are required for
basic operation of an SELinux-enabled system. These utilities include <tt>load_policy</tt>
to load SELinux policies, <tt>setfiles</tt> to label filesystems, <tt>newrole</tt> to
