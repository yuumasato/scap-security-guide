<td>The operating system must provide automated mechanisms for supporting account management functions.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Enterprise environments make account management challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other errors.

A comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.

The automated mechanisms may reside within the operating system itself or may be offered by other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be composed of differing technologies that, when placed together, contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.

Account management functions include: assigning group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.</td>

<td>The operating system must automatically remove or disable temporary user accounts after 72 hours.</td>
<td></td>
<td>If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be used to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts must be set upon account creation.

Temporary accounts are established as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.

If temporary accounts are used, the operating system must be configured to automatically terminate these types of accounts after a DoD-defined time period of 72 hours.

To address access requirements, many operating systems may be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.</td>

The Audit package provides pre-configured  rules in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules. The above content can be found in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules.
To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory:

cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/


Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
augenrules --load

Note: This rule utilizes a file provided by Audit package to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned with your needs.</td>

When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows:

2) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the operating system must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually.

<td>The operating system, for PKI-based authentication, must validate certificates by constructing a certification path (which includes status information) to an accepted trust anchor.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses. Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.</td>

The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the current password. In other words, characters may be the same within the two passwords; however, the positions of the like characters must be different.

If the password length is an odd number then number of changed characters must be rounded up.  For example, a password length of 15 characters must require the change of at least 8 characters.</td>

<td>To assure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, organizational users must be individually identified and authenticated.

A group authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a group authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. Examples of the group authenticator is the UNIX OS "root" user account, the Windows "Administrator" account, the "sa" account, or a "helpdesk" account.

For example, the UNIX and Windows operating systems offer a 'switch user' capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, 'switch' to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a group authenticator.

Users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) need to be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization, which outlines specific user actions that can be performed on the operating system without identification or authentication.

To check that Crypto Policies settings for Kerberos are configured correctly, examine that there is a symlink at
/etc/krb5.conf.d/crypto-policies targeting /etc/cypto-policies/back-ends/krb5.config.
If the symlink exists, kerberos is configured to use the system-wide crypto policy settings.</td>

<td>The information system must automatically remove or disable emergency accounts after the crisis is resolved or 72 hours.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Emergency accounts are privileged accounts that are established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability. 

Emergency accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by the organization's system administrators when network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used accounts are not subject to automatic termination dates.  Emergency accounts are accounts created in response to crisis situations, usually for use by maintenance personnel. The automatic expiration or disabling time period may be extended as needed until the crisis is resolved; however, it must not be extended indefinitely. A permanent account should be established for privileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.

To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. </td>

<td>The operating system must isolate security functions from nonsecurity functions.</td>
<td></td>
<td>An isolation boundary provides access control and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform security functions.

Security functions are the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code.

Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries. Operating systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities.</td>

The structure and content of error messages must be carefully considered by the organization and development team. The extent to which the information system is able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.</td>

The Audit package provides pre-configured  rules in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules. The above content can be found in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules.
To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory:

cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/


Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
augenrules --load

Note: This rule utilizes a file provided by Audit package to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned with your needs.</td>

The Audit package provides pre-configured  rules in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules. The above content can be found in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules.
To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory:

cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/


Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
augenrules --load

Note: This rule utilizes a file provided by Audit package to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned with your needs.</td>

The Audit package provides pre-configured  rules in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules. The above content can be found in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules.
To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory:

cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/


Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
augenrules --load

Note: This rule utilizes a file provided by Audit package to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned with your needs.</td>

The Audit package provides pre-configured  rules in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules. The above content can be found in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules.
To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory:

cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/


Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
augenrules --load

Note: This rule utilizes a file provided by Audit package to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned with your needs.</td>

<td>Once an attacker establishes access to a system, the attacker often attempts to create a persistent method of reestablishing access.  One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to enable an existing disabled account.  Sending notification of account enabling actions to the system administrator and ISSO is one method for mitigating this risk.

The Audit package provides pre-configured  rules in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules. The above content can be found in /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules.
To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory:

cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/


Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
augenrules --load

Note: This rule utilizes a file provided by Audit package to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned with your needs.</td>

To check that the debug-shell service is disabled in system boot configuration,
You'll need to log into a node in the cluster.
As a user with administrator privileges, log into a node in the relevant pool:

$ oc debug node/$NODE_NAME

At the sh-4.4# prompt, run:

# chroot /host


Subsequently,run the following command:
$ systemctl is-enabled debug-shell
Output should indicate the debug-shell service has either not been installed,
or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:
$ systemctl is-enabled debug-shell disabled

Run the following command to verify debug-shell is not active (i.e. not running) through current runtime configuration:
$ systemctl is-active debug-shell

If the service is not running the command will return the following output:
inactive

The service will also be masked, to check that the debug-shell is masked, run the following command:
$ systemctl show debug-shell | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"

If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:

LoadState=masked

UnitFileState=masked

<td>Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.

Note that the Red Hat OpenShift documentation often references a block
device, such as <code>/dev/vda</code>. The name of the available block devices depends
on the underlying infrastructure (bare metal vs cloud), and often the specific
instance type. For example in AWS, some instance types have NVMe drives
(<code>/dev/nvme*</code>), others use <code>/dev/xvda*</code>.

You will need to look for relevant documentation for your infrastructure around this.
In many cases, the simplest thing is to boot a single machine with an Ignition
configuration that just gives you SSH access, and inspect the block devices via
e.g. the <code>lsblk</code> command.

For physical hardware, a good best practice is to reference devices via the
<code>/dev/disk/by-id/</code> or <code>/dev/disk/by-path</code> links.

<td>Failure to provide logical access restrictions associated with changes to system configuration may have significant effects on the overall security of the system.

When dealing with access restrictions pertaining to change control, it should be noted that any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the operating system can have significant effects on the overall security of the system.

Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals should be allowed to obtain access to operating system components for the purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

Logical access restrictions include, for example, controls that restrict access to workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover).</td>

Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common Access Card.

A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.

Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g., VPN, proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the purpose of configuring the device itself (management).

Because of the challenges of applying this requirement on a large scale, organizations are encouraged to only apply this requirement to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability.</td>

The persistent kernel parameter configuration is performed by specifying the appropriate

are found, or the correct assignment is duplicated, remove those offending lines from respective files,
and make sure that exactly one file in

is returned when
$ grep -r kernel.kptr_restrict /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d

<td>The operating system must protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Without protection of communications with wireless peripherals, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read, altered, or used to compromise the operating system.

This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with an operating system. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR Keyboards, Mice, and Pointing Devices and Near Field Communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DoD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the AO. Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the operating system. Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.

Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications with wireless peripherals can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical barriers to wireless radio frequencies) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa. If the wireless peripheral is only passing telemetry data, encryption of the data may not be required.</td>
