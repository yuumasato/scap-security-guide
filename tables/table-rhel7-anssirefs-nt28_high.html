When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory,
only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the

directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky
bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where
there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better
solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application,
consult that application's documentation instead of blindly
changing modes.

Any argument can modify quite significantly the behavior of a program, whether regarding the

level of its specification.

For example, on some systems, the kernel messages are only accessible by root.
If a user nevertheless must have the privileges to read them, the argument of the dmesg command has to be restricted
