Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts,
is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.
Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify
the risk from insider and advanced persistent threats.
<br /><br />
Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks,
which attempt to subvert their normal role of providing some necessary but
limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these programs for
unusual activity.

A TCP SYN flood attack can cause a denial of service by filling a
system's TCP connection table with connections in the SYN_RCVD state.
Syncookies can be used to track a connection when a subsequent ACK is received,
verifying the initiator is attempting a valid connection and is not a flood
source. This feature is activated when a flood condition is detected, and
enables the system to continue servicing valid connection requests.
