If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this misconfiguration should
be investigated and the accounts other than root should be removed or have
their UID changed.
<br />
If the account is associated with system commands or applications the UID
should be changed to one greater than "0" but less than "1000."
Otherwise assign a UID greater than "1000" that has not already been
assigned.

  <td xml:lang="en-US">
An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts
with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to
guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of
sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators
access to root privileges in an accountable manner.

Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and
services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be
necessary to support essential organizational operations.
Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from
a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk
over limiting the services provided by any one component.

To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the
