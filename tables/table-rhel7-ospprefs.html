  <td>Enable Auditing for Processes Which Start Prior to the Audit Daemon</td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
To ensure all processes can be audited, even those which start
prior to the audit daemon, add the argument <tt>audit=1</tt> to the default
GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.
To ensure that <tt>audit=1</tt> is added as a kernel command line
argument to newly installed kernels, ad <tt>audit=1</tt> to the
default Grub2 command line for Linux operating systems.  Modify the line within
<tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> as shown below:
<pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="... audit=1 ..."</pre>
Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:<pre># grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="audit=1"</pre>
  </td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Each process on the system carries an "auditable" flag which indicates whether
its activities can be audited. Although <tt>auditd</tt> takes care of enabling
this for all processes which launch after it does, adding the kernel argument
ensures it is set for every process during boot.

  <td>FAU_GEN.1</td>
  <td>Enable auditd Service</td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
The <tt>auditd</tt> service is an essential userspace component of
the Linux Auditing System, as it is responsible for writing audit records to
disk.

The <code>auditd</code> service can be enabled with the following command:
<pre>$ sudo systemctl enable auditd.service</pre>
  </td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult
to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.
Ensuring the <tt>auditd</tt> service is active ensures audit records
generated by the kernel are appropriately recorded.
<br /><br />
Additionally, a properly configured audit subsystem ensures that actions of
individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they
can be held accountable for their actions.

A log server (loghost) receives syslog messages from one or more
systems. This data can be used as an additional log source in the event a
system is compromised and its local logs are suspect. Forwarding log messages
to a remote loghost also provides system administrators with a centralized
place to view the status of multiple hosts within the enterprise.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes

  <td xml:lang="en-US">
To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software packages
come from Red Hat (and to connect to the Red Hat Network to receive them),
the Red Hat GPG key must properly be installed. To install the Red Hat GPG
key, run:
<pre>$ sudo subscription-manager register</pre>

If the system is not connected to the Internet or an RHN Satellite, then
install the Red Hat GPG key from trusted media such as the Red Hat
installation CD-ROM or DVD. Assuming the disc is mounted in
<tt>/media/cdrom</tt>, use the following command as the root user to import
it into the keyring:
<pre>$ sudo rpm --import /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY</pre>

Alternatively, the key may be pre-loaded during the RHEL installation. In
such cases, the key can be installed by running the following command:
<pre>sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release</pre>
