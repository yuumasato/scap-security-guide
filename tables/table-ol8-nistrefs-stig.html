If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this misconfiguration should
be investigated and the accounts other than root should be removed or have
their UID changed.
<br />
If the account is associated with system commands or applications the UID
should be changed to one greater than "0" but less than "1000."
Otherwise assign a UID greater than "1000" that has not already been
assigned.

  <td xml:lang="en-US">
An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts
with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to
guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of
sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators
access to root privileges in an accountable manner.

Configure kernel to prevent modification of login UIDs once they are set.
Changing login UIDs while this configuration is enforced requires special capabilities which are not available to unprivileged users.

<pre>## Make the loginuid immutable. This prevents tampering with the auid.
--loginuid-immutable

Temporary accounts are established as part of normal account activation
procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts. In the event
temporary or emergency accounts are required, configure the system to
terminate them after a documented time period. For every temporary and
emergency account, run the following command to set an expiration date on
it, substituting <tt><i>USER</i></tt> and <tt><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></tt>
appropriately:
<pre>$ sudo chage -E <i>YYYY-MM-DD USER</i></pre>

configured to automatically terminate these types of accounts after a

If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for

When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory,
only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the
directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky
bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where
there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better
solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application,
consult that application's documentation instead of blindly
changing modes.

  <td>Encrypt Partitions</td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
Oracle Linux 8 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br /><br />
For manual installations, select the <tt>Encrypt</tt> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br /><br />
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <tt>--encrypted</tt> and <tt>--passphrase=</tt> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <tt>--passphrase=</tt> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br /><br />
By default, the <tt>Anaconda</tt> installer uses <tt>aes-xts-plain64</tt> cipher
with a minimum <tt>512</tt> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.

<br /><br />
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the Oracle Linux 8 Documentation web site:<br />

The use of wireless networking can introduce many different attack vectors into

attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also
serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial of
