  <td>Enable Auditing to Start Prior to the Audit Daemon in zIPL</td>
  <td xml:lang="en-US">
To ensure all processes can be audited, even those which start prior to the audit daemon,
check that all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>audit=1</tt>
included in its options.<br />

To ensure that new kernels and boot entries continue to enable audit,

Each process on the system carries an "auditable" flag which indicates whether
its activities can be audited. Although <tt>auditd</tt> takes care of enabling
this for all processes which launch after it does, adding the kernel argument
ensures it is set for every process during boot.

To improve the kernel capacity to queue all log events, even those which start prior to the audit daemon,
check that all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>audit_backlog_limit=8192</tt>

audit_backlog_limit sets the queue length for audit events awaiting transfer
to the audit daemon. Until the audit daemon is up and running, all log messages
are stored in this queue.  If the queue is overrun during boot process, the action
defined by audit failure flag is taken.
