<td>Configuring the operating system to implement organization-wide security implementation guides and security checklists verifies compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across the DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements. 
 
Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Security-related parameters are parameters impacting the security state of the system, including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example, registry settings; account, file, and directory permission settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections.</td>

<td>OL 8 vendor-packaged system security patches and updates must be installed and up to date.</td>
<td>Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT) systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application software patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals.  
 
New patches are released daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.</td>
<td>Verify the operating system security patches and updates are installed and up to date. Updates are required to be applied with a frequency determined by the site or Program Management Office (PMO). 
 
Obtain the list of available package security updates from Oracle. The URL for updates is https://linux.oracle.com/errata/. It is important to note that updates provided by Oracle may not be present on the system if the underlying packages are not installed. 
 
Check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system with the following command: 
 
$ sudo yum history list | more

<td>OL 8 must implement NIST FIPS-validated cryptography for the following: to provision digital signatures, to generate cryptographic hashes, and to protect data requiring data-at-rest protections in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.</td>
<td>Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of using encryption to protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated. 
 
OL 8 uses GRUB 2 as the default bootloader. Note that GRUB 2 reads its configuration from the "/boot/grub2/grub.cfg" file on traditional BIOS-based machines and from the "/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg" file on UEFI machines. 
 
The fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during system installation so that key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users should also ensure the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed. The recommended number of keystrokes is 256 and more. Fewer than 256 keystrokes may generate a non-unique key.

<td>Verify the operating system implements DoD-approved encryption to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions.

Check to see if FIPS mode is enabled with the following command:

FIPS mode is enabled

If FIPS mode is "enabled", check to see if the kernel command line is configured to use FIPS mode with the following command:

$ sudo grep fips /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

If the kernel command line is configured to use FIPS mode, check to see if the system is in FIPS mode with the following command:

$ sudo cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled

1

If FIPS mode is not "enabled", the kernel command line does not have a FIPS entry, or the system has a value of "0" for "fips_enabled" in "/proc/sys/crypto", this is a finding.</td>
<td>Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by following the steps below:

To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel boot parameters during system installation so key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place.

Enable FIPS mode after installation (not strict FIPS compliant) with the following command:

$ sudo fips-mode-setup --enable

Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.</td>

<td>All OL 8 local disk partitions must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information that requires at-rest protection.</td>
<td>OL 8 systems handling data requiring "data-at-rest" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest. 
 
Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000185-GPOS-00079, SRG-OS-000404-GPOS-00183, SRG-OS-000405-GPOS-00184</td>
<td>Verify OL 8 prevents unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information requiring at rest protection by using disk encryption. 
 
If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest encryption, this requirement is not applicable. 
 
Determine the partition layout for the system with the following command: 
 
$ sudo lsblk 
 
Verify all system partitions are encrypted with the following command: 
 
$ sudo more /etc/crypttab 
 
Every persistent disk partition present must have an entry in the file.  
 
If any partitions other than pseudo file systems (such as "/proc" or "/sys") are not listed, this is a finding.</td>
<td>Configure OL 8 to prevent unauthorized modification of all information at rest by using disk encryption. 
 
Encrypting a partition in an already-installed system is more difficult because existing partitions will need to be resized and changed.  
 
To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in the partition layout.</td>

<td>All OL 8 remote access methods must be monitored.</td>
<td>Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated monitoring capabilities increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best. 
 
Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. 
 
Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyberattacks and ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote access capabilities, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets).</td>

<td>OL 8, for PKI-based authentication, must validate certificates by constructing a certification path (which includes status information) to an accepted trust anchor.</td>
<td>Without path validation, the relying party cannot make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. 
 
A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. 
 
When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA. 
 
This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses. Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.

<td>Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.

Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating system. The operating system's Information Management Officer (IMO)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and SAs must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

Notifications provided by information systems include messages to local computer consoles and/or hardware indications, such as lights.

This capability must take into account operational requirements for availability for selecting an appropriate response. The organization may choose to shut down or restart the information system upon security function anomaly detection.

OL 8 comes with many optional software packages, including the file integrity tool Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE). This requirement assumes the use of AIDE; however, a different tool may be used if the requirements are met. Note that AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so a cron job is recommended that uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity check.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000363-GPOS-00150, SRG-OS-000446-GPOS-00200, SRG-OS-000447-GPOS-00201</td>

If AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are performed on the system.

Check that OL 8 routinely executes a file integrity scan for changes to the system baseline. The command used in the example will use a daily occurrence.

Check the cron directories for scripts controlling the execution and notification of results of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following commands:

$ sudo ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 29 Nov 22 2015 aide

$ sudo grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root

$ sudo more /etc/cron.daily/aide

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.

When DAC policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained as to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Therefore, while MAC imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of DAC require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of DAC.

<td>OL 8 must prevent a user from overriding the session lock-enabled setting for the graphical user interface.</td>
<td>A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock. 
 
The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled. 
 
Implementing session settings will have little value if a user is able to manipulate these settings from the defaults prescribed in the other requirements of this implementation guide. 
 
Locking these settings from non-privileged users is crucial to maintaining a protected baseline.

<td>Using an authentication device, such as a Common Access Card (CAC) or token that is separate from the information system, ensures that even if the information system is compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the authentication device. 
 
Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD CAC. 
 
There are various methods of implementing multifactor authentication for OL 8. Some methods include a local system multifactor account mapping or joining the system to a domain and using an idM server or Microsoft Windows Active Directory server. Any of these methods will require that the client operating system handle the multifactor authentication correctly.

<td>Unauthorized disclosure of audit records can reveal system and configuration data to attackers, thus compromising its confidentiality. 
 
Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, audit reports) needed to successfully audit OL 8 system activity.

In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit system to potentially hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back. A system reboot would be noticeable and a system administrator could then investigate the unauthorized changes.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter). The "crontab" command is used to maintain crontab files for individual users. Crontab is the program used to install, remove, or list the tables used to drive the cron daemon. This is similar to the task scheduler used in other operating systems. 
 
When a user logs on, the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to "-1". The AUID representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals "4294967295". The audit system interprets "-1", "4294967295", and "unset" in the same way.

When a user logs on, the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to "-1". The AUID representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals "4294967295". The audit system interprets "-1", "4294967295", and "unset" in the same way.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter). The "kmod" command is used to control Linux Kernel modules. 
 
The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records. 
 
DoD has defined the list of events for which OL 8 will provide an audit record generation capability as the following: 
 
1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels); 
 
2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system; 
 
3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and 
 
4) All kernel module load, unload, and restart actions.

Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network. 
 
Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints). 
 
If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common time reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis.

A System Administrator may have a stance in which they want to protect clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a "no" setting. 
 
X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X11 authorization database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection. An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring if the "ForwardX11Trusted" option is also enabled.
