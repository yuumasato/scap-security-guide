<td>The SUSE operating system default permissions must be defined in such a way that all authenticated users can only read and modify their own files.</td>
<td>The umask value influences the permissions assigned to files when they are created.
A misconfigured umask value could result in files with excessive permissions that can be read and
written to by unauthorized users.</td>
<td>Verify the UMASK setting is configured correctly in the /etc/login.defs file by
running the following command:
# grep -i "UMASK" /etc/login.defs
All output must show the value of umask set as shown in the below:
# grep -i "UMASK" /etc/login.defs
umask 
      Is it the case that the above command returns no output, or if the umask is configured incorrectly?
