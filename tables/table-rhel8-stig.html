<td><pre>The risk of a system's physical compromise, particularly mobile systems such as
laptops, places its data at risk of compromise.  Encrypting this data mitigates

The boot partition and pseudo-file systems, such as /proc, /sys, and tmpfs,
are not required to use disk encryption and are not a finding.
      Is it the case that partitions do not have a type of crypto_LUKS?
      </pre></td>
<td><pre>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
By default, the <code>Anaconda</code> installer uses <code>aes-xts-plain64</code> cipher
with a minimum <code>512</code> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.

<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Documentation web site:<br>

correct persistent configuration, and rebooting the system.

The persistent kernel parameter configuration is performed by specifying the appropriate

It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code
into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system
activity from the audit logs.

provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified,
manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or
