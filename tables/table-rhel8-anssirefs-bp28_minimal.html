<br /><br />
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
possble combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
Requiring a minimum number of special characters makes password guessing attacks
more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.

Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard

kepy in plain text.
